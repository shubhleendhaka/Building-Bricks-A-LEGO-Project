Building Bricks is an exploratory data analysis visualization project centered on LEGO sets, pieces, colors, and themes. Within the expansive LEGO universe, consumers frequently encounter challenges in comprehending the extensive product range. Questions such as 'How have set sizes evolved over time?' and 'Which sets exhibit the most overlap?' commonly arise.

The primary objective of our visualizations is to assist LEGO consumers, both casual enthusiasts and dedicated fans, in developing a comprehensive understanding of LEGO products in an easily digestible manner. Through these visualizations, we seek to illuminate trends in product evolution over the years and unveil associations between various sets and themes.

This project caters to a diverse audience, including casual LEGO enthusiasts and more avid collectors, aiming to provide valuable insights and a macroscopic perspective on the LEGO product landscape. By addressing these inquiries through visual storytelling, Building Bricks aims to enhance the overall LEGO experience, making data on sets, pieces, and themes accessible and engaging for a broad audience.

The project is designed to be optimal on a screensize of 1536 x 725 and is supported on the Chrome browser.
